# Advanced Applied Econometrics -- Summer 2025


#### Maximilian Blesch (MB), Peter Haan (PH), Maxi Schaller (MS), Hannes Ullrich (HU), Felix Weinhardt (FW)

### Course organization

- The course takes place on Fridays (unless noted otherwise), 9:00 - 12:00 at DIW Berlin (Ostrom Hall).
- All material can be found here: https://github.com/AppliedEconBerlin/bse_gc_aae_2025
- PhD: Credit points: 9 ECTS
- Master: Credit points: 6 ECTS
- First session: April 25, 2025
- Final session: July 11, 2025
- Exam: July 18, 2025
- Compulsory reading in bold.
- PhD Evaluation: if this course is taken for credits, the final grade will be determined by
    - 4 problem sets (to be completed in groups of max. 2 participants), weighted 1/8 each,
    - a final exam, weighted 1/2.
- Master Evaluation: 
    - Master students need to hand in 3 out of 4 problem sets (to be completed in groups of max. 2 participants). These 3 problem sets will be graded. To qualify for the final exam, a student needs to pass each of the 3 problem sets. A pass requires to get 60% of the points in the problem set. The grade for the course is based on the final exam only.

### Course objectives

- Discuss central methods and current advances in applied econometrics.
- Provide insights into empirical strategies developed in important papers in the Labour, Public & IO literatures (now applied in many other fields), with a focus on identification.
- Discuss in-depth a variety of econometric frameworks and their core assumptions for causal and counterfactual analysis. Give students an understanding of why and when adding structure informed by economic theory can be important.
- Establish basic estimation techniques & numerical methods such as simulation and numerical integration.


### Exam Information:
- Date: **July 18, 9am**; Elinor Ostrom Hall (DIW); duration 2hrs
- All material covered in the course is relevant for the exam.
- There will be no questions on Python/Coding. However, the problem sets are relevant for the exam. You have to be able to conceptually discuss all covered models and implementation techniques.
- Structure: 1/2 Part I (FW), 1/2 Part II: IO (HU) & labor (PH)
- Allowed materials:
    - You are allowed to bring your own written or printed out notes (10 sheets of A4 paper, double-sided). No other lecture/exercise/reading material.

## Lectures


### 1 Omitted Variable Bias, Assessing Models, Fisher Inference, Stata (April 25, FW)

In this session, we will cover different topics of general interest before turning to more specific methods.
These are (a) sometimes we are just left with the OLS. Can we learn anything from coefficient movements
and the stability of our estimates when including or excluding more controls? We will explore different methods and their interpretation under homogeneous and heterogeneous treatment effects. (b) In this course, we will not
talk about inference much, but here is one powerful method for inference in experiments (that can also be
applied in non-experimental settings) that works without distributional assumptions, it's Fisher inference... there is a very good chance we will only get to look at Fisher in week 2, though,
(c) We will use Stata for both topics, so this is being introduced alongside. Students have in the past used R (at their own risk) in the beginning - by the end of the course everyone was on Stata.

- Assessing endogeneity problems in OLS through coefficient movements
- Introduction to Stata software
- Fisher inference (potentially next week)

## Lectures - Part 2

In the second part of the lecture, solutions to the problem sets and their discussion are conducted using Python. After Lecture 5, an installation guide and resources for setting up Python on your computer will be provided. The discussion of the exercises will take place interactively during the lectures:

- Up to three teams will present different parts of the problem set.
- Students are not expected to have perfect solutions but should discuss their challenges and obstacles.
- Solutions to the problem sets will be provided one day before the lecture.
- Deadlines for graded problem sets are on Wednesdays at 23:59, prior to the lecture.

These problem sets will likely require significant time investment. Please make sure to plan ahead so that you have sufficient time available in this period.
